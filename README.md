# CuratedRetroGames
A List of Curated Game Names for Popular Retro Consoles.  

With the rise of retro game collecting, emulation, and given the huge libraries of games per console, I'd like to try to complile information about what the must play games are for each console.  Basically trying to widdle down for the collector or emulator what to try to find and play.  One of the goals here is to be able to help people be able to put together an organized physical or emulated limited collection of games to actually be able to easily browse and play, not just a wall of game names to collect as a completionist.  i.e. The goal is to provide resources so people can make quality game selections based on what they care about, not create huge quanity of games in a collection.  

This project's goal is to create a list of games per concole with information including:   
- Console exclusivity 
- Alternate versions on different consoles (ports, remakes) 
- Is a PC version available and is it considered markedly better?
- Is there an Arcade version and it it considered markedly better?
- Popularity (i.e. on top 10 / 25 / 100 lists)
- Hidden Gems (Not in the top game lists, but widespread following)

Other information that may be added:
- Genre of Game 
- Number of Players
- Special controller support
- Online Play

This project purposely does not focus on how to find games, rarity, or pricing information.  

This project is meant to grow over time and will rely on community participation through suggesting updates and additions.
Initially the project will concentrate on the most popular systems per generation of console and will start with the oldest consoles first.
